    "Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "It is requested to investigate any relationship between the touchdown distance of the aircraft known as the X-15 and the following parameters, Indicated airspeed, groundspeed and Distance to touchdown at 1 mile to landing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is envisaged that as a result of energy in the aircraft, that the landing distance will vary.\n",
    "Energy in the aircraft will be proportional to the Vertical velocity, Airspeed and Groundspeed and in turn the energy in the aircraft needs to be 'depeleted sufficiently' to allow the aircraft to land.\n",
    "The measurement of this is the distance used during the slideout (usually known as rollout on wheels)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is supplied in the document 'STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF LANDING CONTACT CONDITIONS OF THE X-15 AIRPLANE' at the URL https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670005606.pdf "

    "The Datasets that I would be used to which would be interesting to investigate would not be allowed to be put up on GITHUB for anyone to download - even if the datsets were 'shifted/translated' along the X-axis or scaled up/down the Y-axis.\n",
